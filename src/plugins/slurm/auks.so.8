auks.so \- AUKS SLURM spank plugin

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.LP
\fBauks.so\fR is a SLURM spank plugin that adds Kerberos credential support 
to SLURM using \fBAUKS API\fR. This plugin is enabled using the SLURM SPANK 
configuration file \fB/etc/slurm/plugstack.conf\fR according to the syntax 
mentionned in the previous synopsis.

.LP
\fBauks.so\fR SPANK plugin adds a \fB--auks\fR options to SLURM 
command line clients \fBsrun\fB, \fBsalloc\fR and \fBsbatch\fR.
This mechanism can alternatively be activated setting the \fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR 
environment variable to \fByes\fR.

.LP
Using \fBauks.so\fR, SLURM \fBclient commands\fR forwards the user kerberos 
credential to the \fBAUKS\fR daemon and set \fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR to \fBdone\fR 
prior to execute, allocate or submit.

.LP
\fBslurmstepd\fR, SLURM execution daemon, loading \fBauks.so\fR, checks that 
\fBSLURM_SPANK_AUKS\fR is set to \fBdone\fR and get user's credential using 
\fBAUKS API\fR.
To perform this get operation, \fBslurmstepd\fR user, i.e. \fBroot\fR, must have 
a valid kerberos credential in its environment. This can be enforced using 
\fBaukspriv\fR. The credential must also correspond to a principal associated 
with the \fBAUKS admin role\fR in the \fBauksd\fR ACL file \fBauks.acl\fR.

.LP
\fBslurmstepd\fR, during SPANK temporary privileges drop, launches a crendential
renewer that is killed at the end of the step, prior credential removal.
Renewal is attempted as long as the credential is valid, first using \fBAUKS\fR 
daemons (requires that user principal is associated to \fBAUKS user role\fR), then 
using \fBKerberos KDC(s)\fR if an error occured.

.LP
\fBKRB5CCNAME\fR environment variable is set in job step environment according to 
the fetched credential enabling the user to access kerberized resources during 
execution.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
\fBconf=file.conf\fR
use file.conf as the configuration file for AUKS API
.LP
.TP
\fBdefault=disabled|enabled\fR
when set to \fBenabled\fR, the plugin is active unless users explicitly 
ask not to use it. The default is \fBdisabled\fR.
.LP
.TP
\fBspankstackcred=no|yes\fR
when set to \fByes\fR, \fBKRB5CCNAME\fR is set in the spank plugins stack
environment too, thus allowing next spank plugins to leverage its usage.
The default is \fBno\fR.
.LP
.TP
\fBminimum_uid=uid\fR
when set to a valid user numerical identifier \fBuid\fR, the plugin is not
active for user having a numerical identifier lower than that value.
The default is \fB0\fR, which allows every user on the system to use auks.
